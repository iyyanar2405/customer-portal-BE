# Generate minimal working version of Actions service

Write-Host "Creating minimal working Actions service by commenting out complex methods..."

# The current service has 26 compilation errors preventing it from running
# The user wants to see the basic Actions queries working based on the ActionsService.md attachment
# Since we've made significant progress reducing from 76 to 26 errors, 
# we should create a minimal working version for demonstration

Write-Host "Strategy: Comment out complex GraphQL operations that have missing method dependencies"
Write-Host "Keep the core functionality: GetActions, GetActionTypes, CreateAction, etc."
Write-Host "This will allow the service to compile and run successfully"

# Priority fixes needed:
# 1. Fix method name mismatches (GetByActionAsync vs GetByActionIdAsync)
# 2. Fix delete methods expecting entity objects instead of IDs
# 3. Comment out methods that don't exist in interfaces
# 4. Fix return type mismatches
